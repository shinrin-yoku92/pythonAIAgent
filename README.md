BOOT.DEV Guided project: Build an AI Agent

What Does the Agent Do?

The program we're building is a CLI tool that:

   1. Accepts a coding task
   2. Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task, for example:
       - Scan the files in a directory
       - Read a file's contents
       - Overwrite a file's contents
       - Execute the python interpreter on a file
   3. Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails miserably, which is possible)


Learning Goals

The learning goals of this project are:

    1. Introduce you to multi-directory Python projects
    2. Understand how the AI tools that you'll almost certainly use on the job actually work under the hood
    3. Practice your Python and functional programming skills

The goal is not to build an LLM from scratch, but to instead use a pre-trained LLM to build an agent from scratch.
